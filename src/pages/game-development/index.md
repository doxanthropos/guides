## Game Development

Game development is the process to create a (computer/video) game. It includes many kinds of professions. Some of them involve coding, but there are a lot of other skills needed. Big game studios usually have a lot of very specialized people working on their games, but smaller game studios can require a more broad skillset from the developers, going down to the smallest teams, that are sometimes just one person doing all the development on their own.

## Roles in game development

Beside the non-development roles in game development, Wikipedia lists [6 different roles for people in game development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development#Development_team):

* Designer
* Artist
* Programmer
* Level designer
* Sound engineer
* Tester

These will be different people in game companies, but for your first games, you will usually do a lot of them yourself.

If you do not have the skills for one of these roles (coders sometimes struggle with art and sound), you can find a lot of free resources online, but you have to make sure that they are really released under a license that permits you to use them for your game and under which conditions you are allowed to do so ([someone compiled a nice list of sites with game resources on github](https://gist.github.com/EndangeredMassa/6b177f36b08a5b0798cf)).

If on the other hand, programming is the skill you are not good enough yet to make a game, there are tools for making games that do not require any coding at all, but of course they might be a little more restricted in what you can achieve with them.

## Tools for making a game

### Game engines

The most common tool you will encounter that is made to help you make games is a game engine.

A game engine is a lot of code that can take the form of a library, a framework or even a complete program, that you can use to make a game. It provides ready-made functions for displaying graphics(2D and/or 3D) and sounds, creating a game loop, authoring levels etc.

Two of the best known game engines are the [Unity Engine](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/game-development/unity/) and the [Unreal Engine](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/game-development/unreal-engine/). These are very flexible and can be used to produce games for many different platforms (PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and many more).

On the other end of the spectrum you will find specialized frameworks for only one kind of game or one kind of platform, like [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/), a JavaScript-library, that is made for producing browser games or [Twine](http://twinery.org/), a program that helps you create interactive fiction adventures.

Like it is with any other choice of tools, there is not really a best engine or tool. You have to have an idea of what you want to do and what you are able to use, to find the right engine.

## Where to start?

Think small. You will not be able to produce a 3D massive-multiplayer-online-RPG on your own or as your first game, but you are able to make a game on you own, if you consider your skills and available time.

The websites of the mentioned engines all have some good tutorials about their use. Have a look at them and see where they will take you.

At first it might be good to build on what you already know instead of learning something completely different. So if you come from the FCC curriculum and already have gained some knowledge about JavaScript, going for a web based game and using a JavaScript framework will be a good idea.
